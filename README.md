# Library Management Python Project
It is a Library Management project made within the scope of **Akbank Python Bootcamp**.
 
Before running the Python code, enter the path of the txt file containing your books into the **PATH** variable and the character separating the data (default = comma) into the **SPLITTER** variable.

Afterwards, you can run it and **list** the books with numbers from the menu console, **add** a new book or **remove** any of the existing books.
